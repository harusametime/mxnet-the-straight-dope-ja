    "\n",
    "In the previous tutorials, we taught you about linear regression and softmax regression. We explained how these models work in principle, showed you how to implement them from scratch, and presented a compact implementation using ``gluon``.\n",
    "We explained *how to do things* in ``gluon`` but didn't really explain *how they work*. We relied on ``nn.Sequential``, syntactically convenient shorthand for ``nn.Block`` but didn't peek under the hood.  And while each notebook presented a working, trained model, we didn't show you how to inspect its parameters, save and load models, etc. In this chapter, we'll take a break from modeling to explore the gory details of ``mxnet.gluon``."

    "## So what is a ``Block``?\n",
    "\n",
    "In ``gluon``, a ``Block`` is a generic component in a neural network. The entire network is a ``Block``, each layer is a ``Block``, and we can even have repeating sequences of layers that form an intermediate ``Block``.\n",
    "\n",
    "This might sounds confusing, so let's make it simple. Each neural network has to do the following things:\n",
    "1. Store parameters\n",
    "2. Accept inputs\n",
    "3. Produce outputs (the forward pass)\n",
    "4. Take derivatives (the backward pass)\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be said for the network as a whole, but it can also be said of each individual layer. A single fully-connected layer is parameterized by a weight matrix and a bias vector, produces outputs from inputs, and, given the derivative of some objective with respect to its outputs, can calculate the derivative with respect to its inputs. \n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, MXNet can take derivatives automatically. So we only have to define the forward pass (``forward(self, x)``). Then, using ``mxnet.autograd``, ``gluon`` can handle the backward pass. This is quite a powerful interface. For example we could define the forward pass for some component to take multiple inputs and combine them in arbitrary ways. We can even compose the ``forward()`` function such that it throws together a different architecture on the fly depending on some conditions that we could specify in Python. As long as the result is an NDArray, we're in the clear.  "

This coerces ``gluon`` to give each parameter an appropriate name, indicating which model it belongs to, e.g. ``sequential8_dense2_weight``. Keeping these names straight makes our lives much easier once we start writing more complex code where we might be working with multiple models and saving and loading the parameters of each. It helps us to make sure that we associate each weight with the right model."
